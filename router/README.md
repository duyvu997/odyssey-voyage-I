✏️ Downloading the router. 
The Apollo Router is a high-performance graph router built in Rust. It's available as an executable binary that you can add to your project in a few steps:  

Open a terminal window and navigate to the router directory in the FlyBy project.
```
cd router
```
So far, we only have the .env file in here with our environment variables.

```
📦 router
┣ 📄 .env
```
We'll download the Router by running the install command in the terminal.  
router. 
`curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/latest | sh`. 

Note: Visit the official documentation to explore alternate methods of downloading the Router.  

Now when we check the contents of our router directory, we'll see that we have a new file also called router!  
```
📦 router
┣ 📄 .env
┗ 📄 router
```
